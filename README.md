🎓 Rank of a Student After Updation
📖 Overview
Rank of a Student After Updation is a simple Python-based logic project that calculates a student's updated rank in a list after marks have been modified. It was created as part of my early learning phase to build problem-solving skills using arrays, sorting, and conditional logic.

🧠 Description
The program takes a list of student scores and updates the marks of a specific student. After the update, it recalculates the rank of that student based on the new scores in descending order (highest marks → rank 1).

💡 Features
Accepts multiple students' marks

Updates a specific student's score

Re-sorts the list and recalculates ranks

Returns the updated rank of the student

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python – Core logic and computation

No frontend – Console-based application

🔍 How It Works
Input the marks of all students.

Specify which student's marks to update and provide the new score.

The list is sorted again based on updated scores.

The updated rank of the student is displayed.

🎯 Learning Goals
Strengthen basics of arrays/lists in Python

Practice sorting algorithms and ranking logic

Build clean, modular code with user input handling

🤝 Contributions
This is a basic logic-focused project. Contributions or suggestions for edge case handling or optimization are most welcome!
